### Hi there 👋🏻
I'm **Ehren Nwokocha**. I'm a ***hugeee*** computer fanatic! Anything computers, you can count me in 😂
Here are some things to note about me;

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [this project](https://github.com/Ehren12/C-http-server/)
- 🌱 I’m currently into C and some lower-level stuff.
- 💬 You could ask me about anything concerning tech!
- 📫 How to reach me: You can email me at **nwokochaehren@gmail.com**
- 😄 Pronouns: he/his
- 🙃 Feel free to collaborate on my projects

To be honest, it's not easy balancing school and programming, they are both things that need a lot of attention in order to be good at them😅. However, I'm able to balance my school life 📚, my life as a programmer 💻, and my personal life 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧which is something I feel very proud of.

## Some of my ***history*** 
I started software development when I was *10* years old.
My very first language was ***Python*** and over the years my knowledge in various languages and tools like; ***Nextjs***, ***C***, and ***Typescript*** has only grown larger.

I have so many mentors and people I look up to in the tech space, and really wish to use technology as a tool to make human life and our ~~earth~~ *planet* at large **better**.

## Some Stats
As you can see my GitHub needs a little bit more work 😅
