To be honest its not easy balancing school and programming, they are both things that need a lot of attentention in order to be good at them😅. However, I'm able to balance my school life 📚, my life as a programmer 💻 and my personal life 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧which is something I feel very proud of.

## Some of my ***history*** 
I started software development when i was *10* years old.
My very first language was ***Python*** and over the years my knowledge in various languages like; ***Nodejs*** and ***Typescript*** have only grown larger.

I have so many mentors and people I look up to in the tech space, and really wish to use technology as a tool to make human life and our ~~earth~~ *planet* at large **better**.

## Some technologies I know and plan to learn
