### Hi there 👋🏻
I'm **Ehren Chinonso Nwokocha** and 👁️ 💖 emojis. I'm also a ***hugeee*** computer fanatic! Anything computers, you can count me in 😂
Here are some things to note about me;

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [this project](https://github.com/Ehren12/ehren-website/) and something special I'll be releasing next fall ⭐.
- 🌱 I’m currently into Nextjs, react and some computer-science theory.
- 💬 You could ask me about anything concerning tech!
- 📫 How to reach me: You can email me at **nwokochaehren@gmail.com**
- 😄 Pronouns: he/his
- 🙃 Feel free to collaborate on my projects

To be honest, it's not easy balancing school and programming, they are both things that need a lot of attention in order to be good at them😅. However, I'm able to balance my school life 📚, my life as a programmer 💻, and my personal life 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧which is something I feel very proud of.


## Some of my ***history*** 
I started software development when I was *10* years old.
My very first language was ***Python*** 🐍 and over the years my knowledge in various languages and tools like; ***Astrojs*** 🚀, ***Nextjs*** ⏩, ***React*** ⚛️, ***C*** 🤓, ***Typescript*** 🏛️, and ***Java*** 👨‍💼 has only grown larger.

I have so many mentors and people I look up to in the tech space, and I wish to use technology to make human life and our ~~earth~~ *planet* at large **better** 🏡.

## Moving forward...
To be honest I love to describe myself as a beginner as I keep learning every day. I want to be very good at my work and be a skilled Software Engineer 🧑‍💻
